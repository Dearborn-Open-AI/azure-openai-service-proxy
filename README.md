# Azure OpenAI Proxy

The goal of the Azure OpenAI proxy service is to simplify access to an Azure OpenAI `Playground` like experience and a limited set of Azure OpenAI APIs for developer events, workshops, and hackathons. Access is granted using a time bound `event code`. 

The solution documentation is published [here](https://gloveboxes.github.io/azure-openai-service-proxy/).
