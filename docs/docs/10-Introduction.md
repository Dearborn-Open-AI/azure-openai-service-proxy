# Introduction to the OpenAI Proxy

The goal of the Azure OpenAI proxy service is to simplify access to an Azure OpenAI `Playground` like experience and a limited set of Azure OpenAI APIs for developer events, workshops, and hackathons. Access is granted using a time bound `event code`. 

An `event code` is typically the name of an event, eg `hackathon`, and is given to the event attendees. The event administrator sets the date/time period the `event code` will be active.

There are two primary use cases for the Azure OpenAI proxy service:

1. Access to an Azure OpenAI Web `Playground like` experience for developers to explore the Azure OpenAI chat completion using the time bound event code.
2. REST API access to the Azure OpenAI APIs for developers to build applications, again using a time bound event code. Initially there are two REST endpoints available via the proxy, `chat completion`, and `embeddings`.

## OpenAI Proxy Playground

The Azure OpenAI proxy service provides a `Playground like` experience for developers to explore the Azure OpenAI chat completion using the time bound event code.
